CNN's Dog and Cat Classification The code and report for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project, which aims to identify whether a picture is of a dog or a cat, are contained in this repository.

Installations Python and Jupyter Notebook were used in the project's implementation. The primary libraries and tools utilized are listed below:
TensorFlow/Keras: Used to construct and train the CNN. Pandas: For working with data. For numerical operations, use numpy. matplotlib: For results visualization. scikit-learn: For measures of assessment.

Motivation for the Project This project's main goal is to:
Develop a deep learning model for categorizing photos as either dogs or cats. Show how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to solve image categorization challenges. When training deep learning models, deal with issues like overfitting and computational complexity. This research demonstrates CNNs' usefulness and potential for computer vision tasks.

Descriptions of Files The files in this repository include:
Code and results are kept in the main notebook, cnn_dog_cat_classification.ipynb. Datasets for testing, validation, and training: derived from the Cats and Dogs dataset on Kaggle, which was utilized to construct and assess the model.

Findings Following 25 epochs of CNN training, the model produced:
83% is the test accuracy. The outcomes show how well the model performs in differentiating between dogs and cats. Both classes showed a balanced level of accuracy, with few misclassifications.
